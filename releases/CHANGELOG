Changelog for the Koryuu firmware
=================================

Version 1.1
-----------
    Notes:
      - Official release version.
      - Will be shipped on new Koryuu units.

    Changes:
      - Made "-ntp" firmware variants disable free-run mode statically.

Version 1.1-RC3
---------------
    Notes:
      - Third release candidate.
      - Intended as the firmware the second Koryuu batch ships with.

    Fixes:
      - Fully setup encoder on change of free-run status.
        - One user reported that -RC2 sometimes failed to wake up from sleep
          if an input was activated after a period of having no active input.

Version 1.1-RC2
---------------
    Notes:
      - Second release candidate.
      - Intended as the firmware the second Koryuu batch ships with.

	Fixes:
	  - Attempt to make the "-ntp" firmware more robust.
	    - There was a bug report for 1.1-test1 and 1.1-RC1 where the test
		  pattern was shown when nothing is connected to the CVBS/S-Video
		  inputs. Have been unable to reproduce, but trying to see if
		  consolidating control of the output settings for both the decoder
		  and the encoder will resolve this by eliminating potential corner
		  cases.

Version 1.1-RC1
---------------
    Notes:
      - First release candidate.
      - Intended as the firmware the second Koryuu batch ships with.

    Fixes:
      - Do not automatically overwrite existing settings on EEPROM on startup
        if they are from a newer firmware version.
        - The user can still explicitly trigger the current settings to be
          written by pressing the OPT and INPUT CHANGE buttons simultaneously.

Version 1.1-test1
-----------------
    Notes:
      - A public test version. May have bugs.
      - Continuing to ask for community feedback, especially regarding the
        following issues:
        - NTSC interlaced mode field reversal issue (does it still occur?),
        - Any problems with flickering color or color picture turning into
          monochrome,
        - Sync loss issues on bright flashes on screen.

    Fixes:
      - Reduced the maximum stack frame size (must not waste RAM)
      - Properly track changes to input video standard, re-initialize the
        encoder chip more thoroughly on change.
      - Use 700mV output level both for both luma and chroma output, regardless
        of input video standard.
      - Improve handling of settings
        - Better validation
        - Improved forward compatibility
        - Settings are now marked dirty when loading existing settings with a
          different version, so that the settings are rewritten to EEPROM at
          the first opportunity.

    Not yet fixed:
      - The smoothing continues to be ugly. :(

    Other changes/improvements:
      - The version of the firmware is now embedded in the firmware image.
      - Some build fixes, partly courtesy of clang's stricter interpretation of
        certain aspects of the C++14 standard than avr-g++.

    New features:
      - None. Hoping to stabilize for next official firmware version.

Version 1.1-test0
-----------------
  Notes:
    - A public test version. May have bugs.
    - Asking for community feedback, especially regarding the NTSC
      interlaced mode field reversal issue some users were
      experiencing.

  Fixes:
    - Improved power-up sequence for the video chips.
    - Made transitions between interlaced and progressive modes more
      robust. The OSSC getting confused by Koryuu's output should no
      longer happen, as long as the OSSC firmware version is
      up-to-date (tested with OSSC firmware version 0.86).
    - Hopefully fixed field reversal in NTSC interlaced mode.
      - Feedback from those suffering from this problem with the
        release firmware is more than welcome.

  Not yet fixed:
    - The smoothing is still ugly, thus not very usable. :(

  General improvements:
    - Code cleanups and refactoring with no user-visible functional
      change.

  New features:
    - Separate firmware image (with the "_ntp" suffix), which disables
      video output when no input is detected.
    - Settings can now be saved and are automatically restored on
      power-up.
      - Uses the on-chip EEPROM.
      - Checksummed and versioned to allow firmware updates without
        losing current settings.
      - Saved settings:
        - Default input (Composite/S-Video)
	- Default input pedestal setting (on/off, corresponding to
          NTSC-M/J)
        - Smoothing (on/off)
        - Disable output when no input is detected (on/off)
          - Off by default (test pattern shown when no input).
          - Currently, changing this setting is not exposed, except
            by the separate firmware image.
      - To save current settings, press the INPUT_CHANGE and OPT
        buttons simultaneously.
        - This is a bit timing-sensitive, which has been mitigated by
          requiring the buttons to be pressed a bit longer than before,
          but this requires careful balancing, as making the buttons
          any "laggier" may make the buttons feel unresponsive in other
          contexts. Any feedback regarding the "feel" of the buttons is
          welcome.
        - After hitting the button combo successfully, LEDs flash a few
          times.
        - On failure to hit the button combo, the input/pedestal
          setting and/or the smoothing setting changes, as if one or
          both of the buttons had been hit separately.

Version 1.0
-----------
  Notes:
    - Initial release. Release firmware for the Koryuu.
